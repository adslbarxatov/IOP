# 1. Introduction

⁽¹⁾ ***Objects*** of this Policy (hereinafter referred to as ***Policy Objects***) are products
(including software), materials and developments of the Laboratory.

⁽²⁾ ***Scope*** of this Policy (hereinafter referred to as ***Policy Scope***) is all communities,
channels and hostings managed by the Laboratory, the Laboratory itself, as well as all Policy Objects.

⁽³⁾ This Policy (IOP), its Regulations, Conclusion, the Responsibility and Application
order are describing general rules that Laboratory follows in its work and when developing, maintaining
and using Policy Objects.

⁽⁴⁾ ***The Policy is required to be acquainted with by all participants of the Policy Scope and users
of Policy Objects. By starting to work with Policy Objects, you fully agree with this Policy
and accept it!***

# 2. Product regulations

### 1. Lab works on free base

There are no explicit or implied payments and / or restrictions on the Policy Objects or their source
materials, except for the prohibition on appropriation of the ideas and solutions presented therein.
It is reflected in the annotations of the corresponding projects if Objects use components with partially
free and / or more restrictive licenses.

### 2. Lab doesn’t use ads

The Policy Objects have no promotional elements, except for references to other Policy Objects.
All references can only be activated by the user and only manually, i.e. they have no automatic triggers.

### 3. Lab doesn’t use autoupdate

None of Policy Objects can update its functionality without the direct participation of the user.
Non-executable content may be updated automatically if the correct functioning of the Object becomes
impossible without it.

### 4. Lab doesn’t use hidden functionality

Policy Objects have no code with undeclared purposes (uncontrolled updates, data collection, downloading
of third-party content). All features of Objects are described in user guides and / or project summaries.

### 5. Lab doesn’t collect personal data

Policy Objects have no algorithms for collecting, accumulating or transferring of personal information.
All data used by Policy Objects doesn’t leave the user device.

### 6. Lab welcomes interaction

All Policy Objects have developer support. All users can ask for help and support when using Policy Objects.
On the other side, comments, messages, advice and wishes of users allow the Laboratory to improve
the solutions created. They are the main way to improve them. Therefore, all Policy Objects provide
communication channels with the Laboratory.

&nbsp;



# 3. Community regulations

### 1. Lab is against of hurting

No malicious activities allowed in the Policy Scope, including:
- direct offends
- bullying
- deliberate non-pecuniary harm
- deliberate physical damage
- direct threats
- fakes
- disinformation
- destructive criticism (that exists only for criticism and doesn’t contain constructive offers)

*Participation in them or calls for such participation may be grounds for a permanent restriction of access to the Policy Scope*.

### 2. Lab doesn’t deal with “sore issues”

The Policy Scope do not allow discussions, activities and measures on social, political, economic
and other topics, that most likely will cause counterproductive forms of activity described in Community
regulation #1 of this Policy.

*Forcing such discussions and activities can be grounds for a permanent restriction of access to the Policy Scope*.

### 3. Advertisements

Advertisements in the Policy Scope are only allowed in case described in Product regulation #2 of this
Policy. *Untargeted (generic) ads elements can be grounds for a permanent restriction of access to the Policy Scope*.

### 4. Lab doesn’t allow payments and / or restrictions for content

⁽¹⁾ All texts, pictures, diagrams, datasets and other information objects (including the Policy Objects) are
provided by the Laboratory to members and provided by members to the Laboratory free of any restrictions and without
any payments, explicit and implied, subject to compliance with Product regulation #1 of this Policy.

⁽²⁾ All related rights issues are resolved by sender by himself before submitting of content. Non-free content
is removed from Policy Scope.

⁽³⁾ The indication of the content author is allowed. If there is no author information, the user who provided
the content to Laboratory is listed as the creator of the content.

&nbsp;



# 4. Conclusion

⁽⁰⁾ Clauses of the Policy derive one from another and guarantee that:
1. The Laboratory does not include payments, advertising, hidden and / or unannounced features, uncontrolled updates,
   de-anonymization features, and other items in Policy Objects that are inconsistent with this Policy.
2. The Laboratory welcomes cooperation with users offering assistance or requiring assistance in the development and / or
   maintenance of the main and / or subsidiary Policy Objects.
3. The Laboratory, as much as possible, protects members of the Policy Scope from unwanted (unrequested), inappropriate
   (that aren’t in Policy Scope’s aims) and other malicious effects that may be caused by content and activities
   described by Regulations.
4. The Laboratory supports all constructive discussions and critics in the Policy Scope.
5. The Laboratory supports all thematic content in the Policy Scope

&nbsp;



# 5. XPUN control

⁽¹⁾ Some governments have introduced certain restrictive laws of disintegration nature in their territories
that are incompatible with this Policy. The Laboratory sees it as its task to avoid any conflicts associated with
this discrepancy. The only way to do this, available at the time of publication of this Policy revision, is to make
all Policy Objects unavailable in those areas. In this regard, **XPUN control** was developed.

⁽²⁾ This algorithm is present in all actual Policy Objects except those covered by other licenses and policies that
override this Policy. Namely:
- ESHQ mod
- ES: Randomaze mod

⁽³⁾ The only function of XPUN is to restrict the launch of Policy Objects in the following territories:
- Belgium
- Canada
- Czech Republic
- Denmark
- Estonia
- Finland
- Germany
- Ireland
- Italy
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Switzerland
- United Kingdom

&nbsp;



# 6. Responsibility

⁽¹⁾ Policy Objects and any updates are being delivered “as is”. ***Laboratory*** may try to, but
***does not and cannot warrant*** the performance, results, absence of crushes and / or data
losses you may obtain by using them. ***All Policy Objects are used at your own risk***, without
any guarantees and compensations, explicit and implied (except described above). The Policy
doesn’t provide for any liability on the part of the Laboratory.

⁽²⁾ Also, this Policy ***does not apply*** to Policy Objects that:
- Were published outside the Policy Scope without the participation of the Laboratory
- Were modified in any way relative to the official releases of the Laboratory (adding
  and / or removing elements and / or functions, changing the internal composition, functionality
  and / or external presentation)

***The Laboratory does not and cannot guarantee the compliance of such Objects with this Policy***.

&nbsp;



# 7. Application order

1. In the event that any Policy Object conflicts with the Community regulations (even if fully
   compliant with other ones), they will take precedence over the Product regulations in handling
   the conflict.
2. Acquaintance with a Policy is mandatory. Failure to become acquainted with the Policy doesn’t
   deprive the Laboratory administration of the right to apply it.
3. Agreement with the Policy is not required for participation in the Policy Scope.
4. Disagreement with the Policy is not the basis for any sanctions against members of the Policy Scope.
5. Publication of Policy Objects those aren’t consistent with the Policy in materials,
   comments and / or news feeds of the Policy Scope may be limited or terminated at decision of the
   administration.
