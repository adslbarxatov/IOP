# XPUN control

Since 2020, some governments have introduced certain restrictive laws of disintegration nature in their territories
that are incompatible with this Policy. The Laboratory sees it as its task to avoid any conflicts associated with
this discrepancy. The only way to do this, available at the time of publication of this Policy revision, is to make
all Policy Objects unavailable in those areas.

In this regard, **XPUN control** was developed. The current version of the Policy defines that:
- This algorithm is present in all actual Policy Objects except those covered by other licenses and policies that override this Policy. Namely:
    - ESHQ mod
    - ES: Randomaze mod
    - Crazy cheater’s mod
- Its only function is to restrict the launch of Policy Objects in the following territories:
    - Belgium
    - Canada
    - Czech Republic
    - Denmark
    - Estonia
    - Germany
    - Ireland
    - Japan
    - Latvia
    - Lithuania
    - Luxembourg
    - Netherlands
    - Norway
    - Switzerland
    - United Kingdom

&nbsp;



# End user license agreement

Policy Objects and any updates are being delivered “as is”. ***Laboratory*** may try to, but
***does not and cannot warrant*** the performance, results, absence of crushes and / or data
losses you may obtain by using them. ***All Policy Objects are used at your own risk***, without
any guarantees and compensations, explicit and implied (except described above). The Policy
doesn’t provide for any liability on the part of the Laboratory.

&nbsp;



# Application order

1. In the event that any Policy Object conflicts (even if fully compliant with it) with
   the Community Regulations, they will take precedence over the Product Regulations in handling the conflict .

   deprive the Laboratory administration of the right to apply it.
3. Agreement with the Policy is not required for participation in the Policy Scope.

5. Publication of Policy Objects those aren’t consistent with the Policy in materials,
